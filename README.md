Created the list of words already. I realize this game will play out just like Hangman with there being attempts and guessing one word at a time. There will need to be user feedback the whole way through.

Finished the rules. I think this is the point where the game will start, probably with a while loop based on the user's chances/attempts being above 0. I know that the guessed_letter set will be used to prevent repeats, but I'll also need something like a counter to tick down the chances/attempts on a wrong guess, but not repeat guesses for the same letter.
